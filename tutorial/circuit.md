# Stage 2: Attaching the LEDs

Once your illumination has been glued, painted and drilled, you can test how it looks with LEDs.

For testing, we have battery-powered chains of 50 lights in each of the 6 colours, as well as White, Warm White and Rainbow. Please do not cut these tester chains. It is helpful to have them as long as possible to test wiring layouts. 

## 2a) Lighting up

Choose the matching-colored chains for your design and insert them through the back of your illumination in the corresponding places. 

The aim of this step is to check how your illumination looks with the matching colors, and then figure out how to wire it up from the smallest number of chains.

Panels can be lit from the same chain assuming...
* they are the same color
* they are on at the same time as each other
* they are close-enough together

Chains which are permanently on in your design can be powered from the same USB source assuming...
* the total number of LEDs is less than 100 (equivalent to 2Amps at 5V)

Chains which are animated (turned on and off by a controller board) can be powered from the same controller pin

Separate ch
Panels can be 

Chains only have to be cut when...
* you need to change the color
* panels need to be turned on and off separately from each other
